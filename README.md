### Assessment Task: Senior Frontend Developer - Responsive Design for Email Builder

Welcome to our technical assessment for the Senior Frontend Developer role! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in creating a responsive design for the `email-builder-js` project, with a focus on JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Your solution should demonstrate your understanding of best practices in frontend development, responsiveness in dynamic layouts, and proficiency in the mentioned technologies.

### Project Overview

The `email-builder-js` project is a powerful, component-based tool designed to create and edit email templates. For this assessment, you will enhance the existing project by implementing responsive design functionality. Your task will be to extend the editor’s capabilities to support responsive layouts, ensuring emails look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Objective

Your objective is to build a responsive design feature for `email-builder-js`, focusing on the following key requirements:

1. **Implement a Responsive Layout:** Adapt the components to render optimally on both desktop and mobile screens.
2. **Define Breakpoints:** Choose and implement breakpoints that ensure an ideal viewing experience across different devices.
3. **Build Component Styles for Flexibility:** Ensure components can adjust dynamically, maintaining usability and visual coherence across screen sizes.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Create reusable tests to verify that responsiveness is maintained across different resolutions.

### Requirements

Your submission must:

- **Use React and TypeScript:** The project is TypeScript-based, and all modifications should be done with TypeScript in mind. Ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors.
- **Follow Best Practices for Responsive Design:** Utilize CSS Flexbox/Grid and React hooks (if necessary) for responsive functionality.
- **Implement Reusable and Scalable Components:** The components you create or modify should be reusable and structured to facilitate maintenance.
- **Write Documentation:** Document your approach, component structure, and reasoning behind key decisions in the `README.md` file. The documentation should be concise but provide a clear understanding of how you approached responsive design.

### Suggested Approach

1. **Analyze Current Components**  
   - Review the existing layout and structure of `email-builder-js` components.
   - Identify the elements that require responsive adjustments.

2. **Define Breakpoints**  
   - Choose suitable breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
   - Implement media queries in CSS or use libraries that simplify responsive design.

3. **Update Components**  
   - Apply responsive styling to each component to maintain visual harmony across breakpoints.
   - Ensure text, images, and layouts adjust fluidly based on screen size.

4. **Test Responsiveness**  
   - Test your changes on various screen sizes and devices to confirm the components are responsive.
   - Create unit and integration tests to validate responsiveness (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).

### Submission

Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository forked from `https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js`. Your fork should include:

- **Code Implementation:** Modifications and additions you’ve made to implement responsive design.
- **README Documentation:** Describe your approach, reasoning, and any relevant technical details.
- **Tests:** Include test cases for responsive layouts.

Once completed, submit the link to your repository along with any notes or comments on your approach.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Proficiency** in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
- **Responsive Design Quality:** Ability to create a consistent and visually appealing responsive layout.
- **Code Quality and Organization:** Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Testing Rigor:** Thorough and reusable test cases covering responsiveness.
- **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation of your approach.

---

### Tips

- Focus on modularity and reusability. Your solution should ideally allow future developers to expand or alter breakpoints with minimal changes.
- Feel free to use any modern React or CSS tools that enhance responsiveness, but ensure compatibility with the existing codebase.
- Consider accessibility and user experience across devices.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your responsive design solution!
